Multithreading is used to achieve parallelism and can help improve the performance of a program by allowing multiple tasks to be executed at the same time.\n",

    "-Increased Complexity: Multithreaded programs can be more complex and difficult to develop, test, and maintain than single-threaded programs, especially when dealing with shared resources.\n",

    "-Synchronization Overhead: When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization mechanisms must be used to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. This can introduce overhead and reduce performance.\n",

    "-Deadlocks: Multithreaded programs can be prone to deadlocks, which occur when two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources.\n",

Deadlocks can occur when multiple threads access shared resources in a circular or cyclic manner, and each thread is waiting for the other thread to release the resource it needs.\n",

    "Race Condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the timing or sequence of events in different threads. Race conditions can occur when multiple threads access a shared resource and the order or timing of the accesses is not properly controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose two threads attempt to increment a shared counter at the same time. If the counter is initially set to zero, both threads may read the value of the counter as zero, and then both threads may increment the counter and write the value back to memory. In this case, the final value of the counter will be incorrect, since only one thread's increment operation will be reflected in the final value.\n",
