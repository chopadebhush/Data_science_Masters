The aim of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function from input to output by training on a labeled dataset.

This can be useful when obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming. Examples of semi-supervised learning include speech recognition, machine translation, and text classification.\n",

    "Train, test, and validation split is a common approach used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model. The dataset is divided into three parts: a training set, a test set, and a validation set. The importance of each term is explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Training Set: The training set is used to train the machine learning model. The model learns to recognize patterns and relationships within the training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. The more diverse and representative the training data is, the better the model's performance is likely to be. The training set is used to adjust the model's parameters so that it can make accurate predictions on the test and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Test Set: The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. It contains data that the model has not seen before, and the aim is to test how well the model generalizes to new data. The test set is used to calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, which indicate how well the model is performing. The test set is only used once, after the model has been trained, to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Validation Set: The validation set is used to fine-tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. The validation set helps to identify when a model is overfitting and provides a way to adjust the model's parameters to improve its performance on new data. The validation set is used during the training process to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and adjust its parameters accordingly.\n",

    "In summary, the train, test, and validation split is an important approach in machine learning to ensure that the model is performing well on new, unseen data. The training set is used to train the model, the test set is used to evaluate its performance, and the validation set is used to fine-tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting. By using this approach, we can ensure that the model is robust and performs well on a variety of data."
